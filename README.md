## System requirements
The project was tested using:
- Ubuntu 18.06
- ROS Melodic Morenia
- STM32CubeIDE for Linux

## Hardware
<table>
  <tr> <td>Lidar</td> <td>Velodyne VLP-16</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>MCU-platform with built-in programmer</td> <td>STM32F4DISCOVERY</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>IMU</td> <td>MPU-9150</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>UART-to-USB stick</td> <td>any, we used stick based on CP2102 stone</td> </tr>
</table>

The STM32 MCU-platform is chosen as it meets all the requirements described in the paper. The IMU is fed by external MCU reference clock for data rate stability.

## Firmware
The MCU firmware aimed on IMU-data gathering and LiDAR-to-IMU time synchronization. It is designed using STM32CubeIDE for Linux. 
The main source code is placed in [main.c](https://github.com/MobileRoboticsSkoltech/lidar-sync-mimics-gps/blob/main/firmware/Core/Src/main.c) while the other setups are stored in [firmware.ioc](https://github.com/MobileRoboticsSkoltech/lidar-sync-mimics-gps/blob/main/firmware/firmware.ioc) and setup through the IDE GUI. It means there is no need to edit other source files except two mentioned.

## IMU data format
The MCU outputs IMU data as are plain ASCII strings that can be used independently on ROS and may be parsed by another data recording/processing API. These strings contain timestamp (minutes, seconds, subseconds (1/25600000 of second) and IMU data (3D-angular velocity, temperature, 3D-acceleration) with format:  
```
"i0%02x %02x %04x %04x %04x %04x %04x %04x %04x %04x %04x %04x\n"
 \/\__/ \__/ \__/ \_______/ \____________/ \__/ \____________/
 | hour mins secs  subsecs     3D gyro     temp     3D acc
IMU0 identifier for compatibility with other projects
```

## Software
The software consists of ROS drivers for handling Lidar and IMU data and precise timestamping.
Lidar ROS driver is based on common ROS package with our patch for hardware timestamping by mimicking GPS-clock.  
IMU ROS driver is developed from scratch and produces [sensor_msgs/Imu](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Imu.html) messages.
